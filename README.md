# ember-cli-piwik

Inject the Piwik tracking code into an ember-cli application.

**Please note that this is not production-ready software** and that it may lack
many features. Should you feel something is missing or just not right, feel free
to file a new issue or submit a new PR. Your contribution is mostly appreciated.

## Installation

In your project root, run:

```bash
ember install ember-cli-piwik
```

## Configuration

This addon is configured via your application's `config/environment.js` file by
adding two configuration options: `ENV.piwik.sid` and `ENV.piwik.url`.

In order to configure your application, add the following object to your
environments:

```javascript
piwik: {
  sid: 123,
  url: 'https://your-piwik.endpoint.com'
}
```

You can have independent site IDs and URLs per environment, for example:

```javascript
if (environment === 'development') {
  ENV.piwik = {
    sid: 3,
    url: 'http://your.piwik.domain/and/path'
  }
}

// ...

if (environment === 'production') {
  ENV.piwik = {
    sid: 7,
    url: '//another-piwik.endpoint.com'
  }
}
```

Usually though the only difference between environments is the site ID. In such
a situation, the best approach is the following:

```javascript
// config/environment.js
module.exports = function(environment) {
  var ENV = {
    // ...
    piwik: {
      url: 'https://piwik.endpoint.com'
    },
    // ...
  };

  if (environment === 'development') {
    // ...
    ENV.piwik.sid = 2;
  }

  if (environment === 'test') {
    // ...
    ENV.piwik.sid = 7;
  }

  if (environment === 'production') {
    // ...
    ENV.piwik.sid = 19;
  }

  return ENV;
};
```

## Automatic PageView Tracking

This addon can take care of notifying pageviews to the Piwik server when
transitioning into a route automatically.

All you have to do is to extend the main application router with the provided
mixin:

```javascript
// app/router.js
import Ember from 'ember';
import config from './config/environment';
import Piwik from 'ember-cli-piwik/mixins/page-view-tracker';

var Router = Ember.Router.extend(Piwik, {
  location: config.locationType
});

Router.map(function() {
  // ...
});

export default Router;
```

Now when the `didTransition` event fires, the router will call the Piwik tracker
which in turn will emit a `trackPageView` event passing the current URL as the
event title.
