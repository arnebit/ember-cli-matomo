# ember-cli-piwik

Inject the Piwik tracking code into an ember-cli application.

**Please note that this is not production-ready software** and that it may lack 
many features. Should you feel something is missing or just not right, feel free 
to file a new issue or submit a new PR. Your contribution is mostly appreciated.

## Installation

In your project root, run:

```bash
ember install ember-cli-piwik
```

## Configuration

This addon is configured via your application's `config/environment.js` file by 
adding two configuration options: `ENV.piwik.sid` and `ENV.piwik.url`.

In order to configure your application, add the following object to your 
environments:

```javascript
piwik: {
  sid: 123,
  url: 'your-piwik.endpoint.com'
}
```

You can have independent site IDs and URLs per environment, for example:

```javascript
if (environment === 'development') {
  ENV.piwik = {
    sid: 3,
    url: 'your.piwik.domain/and/path'
  }
}

// ...

if (environment === 'production') {
  ENV.piwik = {
    sid: 7,
    url: 'another-piwik.endpoint.com'
  }
}
```

Usually though the only difference between environments is the site ID. In such 
a situation, the best approach is the following:

```javascript
// config/environment.js
module.exports = function (environment) {
  var ENV = {
    // ...
    piwik: {
      url: 'piwik.endpoint.com'
    },
    // ...
  };

  if (environment === 'development') {
    // ...
    ENV.piwik.sid = 2;
  }

  if (environment === 'test') {
    // ...
    ENV.piwik.sid = 7;
  }

  if (environment === 'production') {
    // ...
    ENV.piwik.sid = 19;
  }

  return ENV;
};
```

## Automatic PageView Tracking

This addon can take care of notifying pageviews to the Piwik server when 
transitioning into a route automatically.

All you have to do is to extend the main application router with the provided 
mixin:

```javascript
// app/router.js
import Ember from 'ember';
import config from './config/environment';
import Piwik from 'ember-cli-piwik/mixins/page-view-tracker';

var Router = Ember.Router.extend(Piwik, {
  location: config.locationType
});

Router.map(function () {
  // ...
});

export default Router;
```

Now when the `didTransition` event fires, the router will call the Piwik tracker 
which in turn will emit a `trackPageView` event passing the current URL as the 
event title.

## Content Security Policy (CSP)

Please be aware that [since version 0.0.47][1] ember-cli ships with CSP support 
out of the box through the [ember-cli-content-security-policy][2] addon. 
This is a good thing, as in the proper Ember spirit, it nudges you towards 
adopting the best practices from day 1.

There is an "issue" though: by default, it is configured to be extremely strict 
about script sources and script capabilities.

To make everything run smoothly, make sure you add the URLs you used in your 
Piwik configuration to the relevant options of the CSP settings.

For more information, please refer to the [ember-cli-content-security-policy 
documentation][3].
